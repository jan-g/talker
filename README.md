# Talker server and client

Documentation in the docs/ directory. This is a toy. Some of it is too complicated; some of it could
do with a refactor.

The simple version is in talker/server.py (it uses talker/base.py).

The more complex version that adds server-to-server communication lives in talker/mesh.py.
